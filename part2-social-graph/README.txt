Installations required: SNAP, NetworkX, matplotlib.

Steps:
1. Make sure the input dataset files anon_edge_list.csv and anon_edge_list_tab.txt are present in the current working directory.
2.. Run p2.py

Output:
1. LinkedInGraph.png - the graph plotted from the input dataset.
2. inDegC.InDegreeDistribution.png - the in-degree distribution plot from SNAP.
3. outDegC.OutDegreeDistribution.png - the out-degree distribution plot from SNAP.
4. GiantComponentGraph.png - Plot of sampled edges vs Giant Component size.
5. p2_output.txt - File containing the list of measures and their values computed by this code.
